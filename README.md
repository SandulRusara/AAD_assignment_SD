Introduction :-

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted.
the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted, such as a byte stream,
XML, or JSON.  Deserialization is process, where the stored or transmitted data is converted back into an object.
These processes are essential in various applications including data storage communication between systems
and deep copying of objects.




Benefits of Serialization and Deserialization :-


Serialized data can be easily transmitted over networks, facilitating communication between different systems and platforms.

Serialized objects can be cached to speed up performance by avoiding repetitive computations.

Serialized data can be exchanged between different programming languages and systems, enhancing interoperability.

Serialization allows for creating deep copies of objects, which can be useful in certain scenarios.

Objects can be saved to files or databases and restored later, preserving the state across sessions.



Mechanism of Serialization and Deserialization :-

--Serialization --

The object is converted into a format suitable for storage or transmission.

This involves writing the object's state to a byte stream or another suitable format.

In Java this is typically done using ObjectOutputStream for byte streams.

--Deserialization--

The stored or transmitted data is read and converted back into an object.

This involves reconstructing the object from the serialized data.

In Java this is typically done using ObjectInputStream for byte streams.
